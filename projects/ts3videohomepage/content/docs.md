# Client

## Installation
After downloading the plugin from the website you can simply double click the *.ts3\_plugin file, which will start the Teamspeak plugin installer.
_It's highly recommended to close Teamspeak before trying to install or update the plugin._

__Linux:__ The client plugin for Linux is in development.

__Mac:__ I still don't have a Mac.


# Server

## Installation
The downloaded server package is usually a simple ZIP archive, which can be extracted wherever you want it.

__Windows:__ `C:\ts3video-server`

__Linux:__ `/opt/ts3video-server`

## Configuration
The server provides multiple ways of configurations before startup. You can configure it by appending commandline arguments directly or by passing a configuration file during startup.

### Commandline parameters
(TODO) To see a list of all available arguments type `server -h`.

### Config file (Recommended)
Saving your configuration in a file might be the better way to backup your configuration.
See the config file comments for further details.

Currently there is not a lot to configure. The documentation will be updated as soon as new features has been added.

## Run as Windows Service
Registering the server process as a service can be done with the built-in Windows tool `sc`.
All upcoming commands need to run as privileged Administrator.

__Install__
`sc create "ts3video-server" binPath= "C:\path\app.exe" start= auto obj= ".\manuel" password= "" `


## Run as Linux Daemon
